  "description": "Hi! ðŸ‘‹\n\n\nI'm a web developer and designer from Argentina with 6+ years of experience using mostly React. My design background allows me to create products that are true to the creative processes.\n\n\nI'm always looking for something new to learn or some DIY project to carry out. I'm a free/open source software enthusiast, and in my free time I like watching movies, TV shows, reading books and playing video games.\n",
